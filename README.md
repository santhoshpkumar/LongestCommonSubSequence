# LongestCommonSubSequence
Given two string sequences, write an algo­rithm to find the length of longest sub­se­quence present in both of them.

What is Longest Com­mon Sub­se­quence: A longest sub­se­quence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous(not sub­string) in both the string.

Example:

String A = "acbaed";

String B = "abcadf";

Longest Common Subsequence Length: 4

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): acad
